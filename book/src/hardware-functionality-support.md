# Hardware &Â Functionality Support

> The tables below indicate whether we support using the piece of functionality in a portable manner, trough an abstraction layer and platform-aware configuration.

## Tier 1

Tier 1 hardware gets regularly tested, either automatically or manually.

<!-- cmdrun ../../doc/gen_support_matrix_html.rs generate ../../doc/support_matrix.yml /dev/stdout --tier 1 -->

## Tier 2

Tier 2 hardware does not get tested as often as Tier 1 hardware, and may not have been tested since its initial port.

<!-- cmdrun ../../doc/gen_support_matrix_html.rs generate ../../doc/support_matrix.yml /dev/stdout --tier 2 -->
